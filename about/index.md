## PETER SKARONIS

### IT SECURITY RESEARCHER // LIFE COACH

I am an IT Security Professional with an interest in IT Security as it links directly with the human psyche and looking at bridging the gap between the corporate and the entrepreneurial world.

I am fascinated by viewing IT Security from the lens of psychology and believe the future of preemptive measures lies in the intersection of psychology and Security.

I also explore human psychology and the reasons behind why we do what we do and how we can take control over our monkey brain at Life Mastery Coach.
