# Techimpossible

Welcome to Techimpossible. This is a blog focusing on Technology, Security and everything in between.

I cover mostly Cyber Security and how to be secure when it comes to your digital self.

I have also started a Wiki covering Cyber Security, Privacy, tools and resources for every day users as well for those aspiring to break into the Cyber Security industry.
